A WordPress plugin for beautiful content that converts. The editor you’ve been waiting for to design your posts.

== Description ==

The time of plain text posts are over. You need content that reflects your brand, stands out, engages your audience and converts them as quickly as possible. **But how do you efficiently design high-impact content experiences, without wasting money on developers and designers?**

**Setka Editor was born** to answer this very question. We have created a robust plugin **accessible to everyone** looking to make unique post layouts without having to deal with CSS or HTML. Setka Editor is the first WYSIWYG plugin with page builder functionality. Its sole purpose is to create beautiful posts as efficiently as possible.

Setka Editor was among the first plugins ready for the release of WordPress 5.0, which includes the new Gutenberg editor. We have developed a Setka Editor content block, which can be used with any other blocks on your page.

>Setka Editor is functional, beautiful, and super-engaging. It’s everything and more I’ve ever dreamt about as a creator of content aimed at millennial audience in an artistically-minded community. At a reasonable price you can suddenly compete with magazines that built their websites with venture capital. I love it!

= 1.16.1 - September 18, 2018 =

Improved compatibility with AMP WP plugin in ‘Paired’ mode.

= 1.16.0 - August 6, 2018 =

Now, we have integrated Setka Editor plugin with the AMP WP plugin. When installed on the same website they automatically increase the loading speed for mobile pages while retaining stylistic and branding elements.

We make it work with all three modes in the AMP WP plugin:

— ‘Classic’ offers a ready-made template for the theme and allows the Google bot to index the pages of the site as soon as the plugin is installed.;
— ‘Paired’ assumes that the owner of the website or the creator of the theme has created separate templates for AMP and other versions of the website.;
— ‘Native’ is seamless integration, where the website is created specifically for AMP, and there is no need to create separate links, templates, and so on.

We wrote four sanitizers for elements that weren’t compatible with AMP notations and created smaller files for styling elements that are in line with the design demands.

1. The animation sanitizer converts Setka Editor animations into AMP animations, while keeping any interactive features like activation on a specific user action or movement of elements.
2. The embed element sanitizer transform a responsive embed into relevant AMP elements and correctly integrates them into the page.
3. The gallery sanitizer transforms the component for displaying a series of images into the relevant AMP element.
4. The image sanitizer displays the srcset attribute with all available resolutions, allowing the browser to decide which size is best for the user. This makes loading images faster and allows content to adapt to a device’s screen size.

So that clients can set up themes for displaying content, Setka created the Style manager.
